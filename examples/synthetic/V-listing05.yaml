# Example~\ref{lst:p1c1.2b} has as an answer: \textbf{There is no conflict of consistency with capacity}.
# First, we calculate the percentage of utilization of the limit of 5 requests every 1 day (86400 seconds), 50000 requests / 86400 seconds,
# that is, $50000/86400=0.5787$; we divide by the capacity $0.5787/10=0.05787=5.787\%$. 
# Since the percentage of utilization is greater than 100 percent, 100\%, $5.787\% \not> 100\%$, 
# there is no conflict of consistency with capacity.
