# Needs:
#   200 requests / 1 day
#   4 requests / 1 second

# Example~\ref{lst:p3a2} has as an answer: \textbf{the plan is not compliant with the user needs}.
# Therefore, the needs of 200 requests every 1 day are not covered by what is offered in the plan, 100 requests every 1 day.
# Similarly, the need for 4 requests every 1 second is covered by what is offered, 2 requests per second.
