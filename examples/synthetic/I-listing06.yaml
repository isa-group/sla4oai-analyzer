# Example~\ref{lst:p1c1.2a} has as an answer: \textbf{There is an conflict of consistency with capacity}.
# First, we calculate the utilization percentage of the limit of 864001 requests every 1 day (86400 seconds), 864001 requests / 86400 seconds,
# that is, $864001/86400=10,069$; we divide by the capacity $10.069/10=1.0069=100.69\%$.
# Since the utilization percentage is greater than 100\%, $100.69\% > 100\%$, there is a conflict of consistency with capacity.
