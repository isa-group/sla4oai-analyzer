# Example~\ref{lst:p1c4b} has as an answer: \textbf{There is no cost consistency conflict},
# because plan 1 offers fewer limitations and a lower cost than plan 2.
# It makes sense that there would be an increase from 10 to 100 requests every 1 second,
# from 100 to 1000 requests every day, and from 10 to 100.
