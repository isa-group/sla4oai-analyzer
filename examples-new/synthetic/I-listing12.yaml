# Example~\ref{lst:p1c4a} has as an answer: \textbf{There is a cost consistency conflict},
# because if the limit of a plan "100 requests every 1 day (plan 1)" 
# has an equivalence in the other of "1000 requests / 1 day (plan 2)", it does not make sense: 
# 1) to reduce it from 10 to 1 request every 1 second in plan 2;
# 2) to reduce the price from \$10 to \$1.
