# Example~\ref{lst:p1c1.1a} has as an answer: \textbf{There is a consistency conflict}.
# First of all, let us suppose that the service's capacity is known, for example, $10^6$.
# The limit with the highest period (1 week) is "10 requests / 1 week" and the percentage of use is $10/10^6=0.001\%$.
# The limit with the smallest period (1 day) is "100 requests / 1 day" and the utilization percentage is $100/10^6=0.01\%$.
# Since $0.001\% < 0.01\%$, we claim that these two limitations are inconsistent.
