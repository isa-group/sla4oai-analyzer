# Needs:
#   50 requests / 1 day
#   1 request / 1 second

# Example~\ref{lst:p3a1} has as an answer: \textbf{the plan is compliant with the user needs}.
# Therefore the needs of 50 requests every 1 day are covered by what is offered in the plan, 100 requests every 1 day.
# Similarly, the need for 1 request for every 1 second is covered by what is offered, 2 requests per second.
