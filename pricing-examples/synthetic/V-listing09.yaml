# Example~\ref{lst:p1c3b} has as an answer: \textbf{There is no consistency conflict between limitations},
# because if each request consumes 0.5 KB, in 1000 KB (1 MB) we would have, at most, $1000/0.5=2000$ requests.
# Given that $1000<2000$, the value of the limit on requests would not enter into any conflict.
