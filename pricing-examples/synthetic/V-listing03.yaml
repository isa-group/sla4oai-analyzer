# Example~\ref{lst:p1c1.1b} has as an answer: \textbf{There is no consistency conflict}.
# First, let us assume that the capacity of the service is $10^6$.
# The limit with the highest period (1 week) is "1000 requests / 1 week" and the usage percentage is $1000/10^6=0.1\%$.
# The limit with the smallest period (1 day) is "100 requests / 1 day" and the utilization percentage is $100/10^6=0.01\%$.
# Since $0.1\% \not< 0.01\%$, we claim that these two limitations are consistent.
